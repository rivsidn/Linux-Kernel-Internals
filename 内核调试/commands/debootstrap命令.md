NAME
       debootstrap - Bootstrap a basic Debian system

SYNOPSIS
       debootstrap [OPTION...]  SUITE TARGET [MIRROR [SCRIPT]]

       debootstrap [OPTION...]  --second-stage

DESCRIPTION
       debootstrap  bootstraps  a basic Debian system of SUITE into TARGET from
       MIRROR by running SCRIPT.  MIRROR can be an http:// or https://  URL,  a
       file:/// URL, or an ssh:/// URL.

       The  SUITE  may  be  a release code name (eg, sid, stretch, jessie) or a
       symbolic name (eg, unstable, testing, stable, oldstable)

       Notice that file:/ URLs are translated to file:///  (correct  scheme  as
       described  in  RFC1738  for local filenames), and file:// will not work.
       ssh://USER@HOST/PATH URLs are retrieved using scp; use of  ssh-agent  or
       similar is strongly recommended.

       Debootstrap  can  be used to install Debian in a system without using an
       installation disk but can also be used to run a different Debian  flavor
       in  a  chroot environment.  This way you can create a full (minimal) De‐
       bian installation which can be used for testing purposes (see the  EXAM‐
       PLES section).  If you are looking for a chroot system to build packages
       please take a look at pbuilder.

OPTIONS
       --arch=ARCH
              Set  the  target architecture (use if dpkg isn't installed).  See
              also --foreign.

       --include=alpha,beta
              Comma separated list of packages which will be added to  download
              and extract lists.

       --exclude=alpha,beta
              Comma separated list of packages which will be removed from down‐
              load  and  extract lists.  WARNING: you can and probably will ex‐
              clude essential packages, be careful using this option.

       --extra-suites=alpha,beta
              Also use packages from the listed suites of the archive.

       --components=alpha,beta
              Use packages from the listed components of the archive.

       --no-resolve-deps
              By default, debootstrap will attempt to automatically resolve any
              missing dependencies, warning if any are found.  Note  that  this
              is not a complete dependency resolve in the sense of dpkg or apt,
              and  that it is far better to specify the entire base system than
              rely on this option.  With this option  set,  this  behaviour  is
              disabled.

       --log-extra-deps
              If  you  want  to  record  additional dependencies when resolving
              package dependencies, set this option to track them  through  de‐
              bootstrap.log.

       --variant=minbase|buildd|fakechroot
              Name  of  the  bootstrap  script  variant to use.  Currently, the
              variants supported are  minbase,  which  only  includes  required
              packages  and  apt;  buildd,  which  installs the build-essential
              packages and fakechroot, which installs the packages without root
              privileges.  The default, with no  --variant=X  argument,  is  to
              create  a  base Debian installation with all packages of priority
              required and important, including apt.

       --merged-usr
              Create /{bin,sbin,lib}/ symlinks pointing to  their  counterparts
              in /usr/.  (Default for most variants and suites.)

       --no-merged-usr
              Do  not  create /{bin,sbin,lib}/ symlinks pointing to their coun‐
              terparts in /usr/.  (Default for the buildd variant of Debian  12
              'bookworm'  or  older,  and all variants of Debian 9 'stretch' or
              older.)

       --keyring=KEYRING
              Override the default keyring for  the  distribution  being  boot‐
              strapped,  and  use  KEYRING to check signatures of retrieved Re‐
              lease files.

       --no-check-sig
              Disables checking OpenPGP signatures of retrieved Release  files.
              Supported since 1.0.139.

       --no-check-gpg
              Deprecated alias for "--no-check-sig".

       --force-check-sig
              Forces  checking OpenPGP Release file signatures, disabling auto‐
              matic fallback to HTTPS in case of a missing keyring.  Incompati‐
              ble with the previous option.  Supported since 1.0.139.

       --force-check-gpg
              Deprecated alias for "--force-check-sig".

       --verbose
              Produce more info about downloading.

       --print-debs
              Print the packages to be installed, and exit.  Note that an empty
              or  non-existing  TARGET  directory must be specified so that de‐
              bootstrap can download Packages files to determine which packages
              should be installed, and to resolve dependencies. The TARGET  di‐
              rectory  will  be deleted unless --keep-debootstrap-dir is speci‐
              fied.

       --download-only
              Download packages, but don't perform installation.

       --foreign
              Do the initial unpack phase of bootstrapping only, for example if
              the target architecture does not match the host architecture.   A
              copy  of  debootstrap  sufficient  for  completing  the bootstrap
              process will be installed as /debootstrap/debootstrap in the tar‐
              get filesystem.  You can run it with the --second-stage option to
              complete the bootstrapping process.

       --second-stage
              Complete the bootstrapping process.  Other arguments  are  gener‐
              ally not needed.

       --second-stage-target=DIR
              Run  second stage in a subdirectory instead of root. (can be used
              to create a foreign chroot) (requires --second-stage)

       --keep-debootstrap-dir
              Don't delete the /debootstrap directory in the target after  com‐
              pleting the installation.

       --cache-dir=DIR
              Cache .deb files under directory. It should be an absolute path.

       --unpack-tarball=FILE
              Acquire  .debs from gzipped tarball FILE (specified with absolute
              path) instead of downloading via HTTP(S).

       --make-tarball=FILE
              Instead of bootstrapping, make  a  gzipped  tarball  (written  to
              FILE)  of  the downloaded packages.  The resulting tarball may be
              passed to a later --unpack-tarball.  Note that an empty  or  non-
              existing  TARGET  directory must be specified so that debootstrap
              can download packages to prepare the tarball. The  TARGET  direc‐
              tory will be deleted unless --keep-debootstrap-dir is specified.

       --debian-installer
              Used for internal purposes by the debian-installer

       --extractor=TYPE
              Override  automatic  .deb extractor selection to TYPE.  Supported
              extractors are: dpkg-deb and ar.

       --no-check-certificate
              Do not check certificate against certificate authorities

       --certificate=FILE
              Use the client certificate stored in file (PEM)

       --private-key=FILE
              Read the private key from file

       --inrelease-path
              Determine the path to the InRelease file of the suite relative to
              the normal position of an InRelease file

EXAMPLES
       To setup a stretch system:

            debootstrap stretch ./stretch-chroot http://deb.debian.org/debian

            debootstrap stretch ./stretch-chroot file:///LOCAL_MIRROR/debian

       Full process to create a complete Debian installation of sid  (unstable)
       in a chroot:

            main # debootstrap sid sid-root http://deb.debian.org/debian/
            [ ... watch it download the whole system ]
            main # echo "proc sid-root/proc proc defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
            main # mount proc sid-root/proc -t proc
            main # echo "sysfs sid-root/sys sysfs defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
            main # mount sysfs sid-root/sys -t sysfs
            main # cp /etc/hosts sid-root/etc/hosts
            main # chroot sid-root /bin/bash
