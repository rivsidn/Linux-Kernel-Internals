fdfbbb35ba5 (tag: 0.96b-patch2) As promised, here is the second patch for 0.96b which hopefully clears up the problems with some mice by implementing most of the serial line flags like 5-8 bit characters and parity. It mainly corrects only serial problems, but there are a couple of other patches in it too: the fsqrt emulation patch is here, so if you already did it, you'll get a bad patch for that file (which you can ignore). This patch also changes all instances of signal-setting to use the "send_sig()" subroutine which should allow gdb to debug all signals.
